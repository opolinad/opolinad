I am a very curious and analytical person, this has made me fit very well into engineering, which, as I see it, is about using the tools that are available (or looking for new tools) in order to provide solutions to problems or improving existing procedures. Taking this into account, I am a fan of it and use it as much as possible in all aspects of my life.

Given my characteristics, I have developed skills that have made it easy to create tools that facilitate the work in the jobs in which I have participated. I like to focus on improving existing processes or just finding a way to make them as simple as possible. To exploit my potential, I have studied React, Redux, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.Js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize and Express technologies (and looking to learn another ones) , for the development of more global and complex solutions
